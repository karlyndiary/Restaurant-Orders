## Case Study
A quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine, including the date and time of each order, the items ordered, and additional details on the type, name and price of the items. Some of the questions that we will look at are the following: 
- What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
- What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?
- Were there certain times that had more or less orders?
- Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?
